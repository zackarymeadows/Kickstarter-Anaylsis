# Kickstarting with Excel

## Analyzing Kickstarter Data with the intention of detecting patterns in successful campaigns

### The Purpose
The Purpose of this Kickstarter analysis was to compare how different campaigns fare in relation to their launch dates and funding goals.  
## Analysis and Challenges
Looking at the raw data was intimidating so first, the successful and failed campaigns were separated and analyzed. After calculating the mean and standard deviation of the successful goals, it became apparent that there were some major outliers.  It's difficult to predict whether a campaign would be blessed with large donors. Perhaps we should delve deeper into the patterns behind large donations. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
When beginning to visualize specifically Theater related kickstarters it becomes apparent that campaigns that launched in the spring and early summer were the most successful. There are exceptions of course, but overall, projects launched in May had the highest success rate. The number of successful campaigns starts dropping steadily throughout the summer and plunges as winter approaches. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Moving onto outcomes based on goals. Looking at general kickstarting campaigns, the average successful campaign had a goal of around $5000. After reducing the data pool to only plays, it appears to support this fact. The success rate starts to drop dramatically after surpassing the average. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
One variable that might have shown a more thorough picture would be demographics. If the information for the target audience of the Kickstarter was available we could see what Age and Gender contribute the most to which category of each campaign. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- Launch Dates in the Spring and Early Summer do well. Launch dates during the winter do not.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- Goals below $5000 were more achievable. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
- One variable that might have shown a more thorough picture would be demographics. If the information for the target audience of the Kickstarter was available we could see what Age and Gender contribute the most to which category of each campaign. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- A graph showing the likelihood of large donations.
